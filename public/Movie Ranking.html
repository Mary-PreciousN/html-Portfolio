<h1>Movie Ranking Project by Angela my mentor</h1>
<h2>My top five best movie of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>From Zero To Hero </h3>
<p>This actually is a Chinese movie, and i was so surprised and didn't want to watch at first, but when i finally did, it was such a great movie!</p>
<p>The movie was about a young man, who was born crippled, but his mom was not ready to give up on him. She wasn't ready for people to look at her son with pity because she believed he had so much in him to give, and she nurtured him, nurtured his talent and stood by him all the way.
He ended up being the fasted runner for China when he ran an international race.<br />
It's so motivational and won't fail to lift your spirit!!<br />

<h3>Nyad</h3>
<p>This movie is about a woman in her early 60's who wanted so badly, to achieve her once failed dream of swimming through states.
She got so discouraaged a couple of times by people who cared about her and her help because of the many risks involved for her, especially seeing that she's no longer as young as she used to be, but she refused to give up and believed in herself.<br />
</p>
<p>She failed three different times!! But just when everyone had gotten tired of the failed attempt and the near death experiences, she finally won!
Breaking the record that was never set till she came through!<br />
</p>
<h3>Sweet Spy</h3>
<p>This was the first Korean movie i ever watched! It's so full of romace, and though i'm not much of a romance fan, i fell inlove with the movie.
PS: Sadly, i never got to watch the last season of the movie. I have been looking for it for so long but found nothing!
</p>
<h3>Five feet apart</h3>
<p>This movie got to open my eyes to the fact that their are so many sicknesses and Diseases in the world, and that people really need to value others while they are still very much alive.
I can remember crying out my eyes after watching it and my sisters wouldn't stop laughing at me. It was really a funny incidence.<br />
</p>
<h3>Blue eye Samuria</h3>
<p>This one isn't a movie, but an anime and seeing that i am a big fan of anime, i couldn't help but add it.
It's about this woman Samuria, who had to conceal the fact that she is a woman in a tasty search of revenge.<br />
You really should try watching it, like anime or not? fan of anime or not? You will really enjoy it.<br />
