<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mary-Precious, a Product Designer and Developer. I have been designing for two years and most recently started coding on 1st January, 2024.
  <br>Coding has always been something i've been very curious about and doing it now has made me understand a couple of things which helps broaden my thoughts.<br />
  I am available to work at the moment, as an intern web developer, and looking forward to being employed to do my first job with you.
